            <p>Git is a great tool. I&#39;ve been using SVN and Mercurial but for me Git hit the
spot. There are times I&#39;m sitting comfortable in chair git pulling or git
pushing feeling the flow and everything is working as expected. But sometimes
I want to change git account to another - private one and there is the hitch.</p>
<h2 id="option-1">Option 1</h2>
<p>I can set global config for my private account</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash">git config --global user.name <span class="hljs-string">"Your Name Here"</span>
git config --global user.email your@email.com</code></pre>

<p>And I can specify individual user.name and user.email to use in specific repo.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash">git config user.name <span class="hljs-string">"Your Name Here"</span>
git config user.email your@email.com</code></pre>

<p>It works over https but what about ssh? I want to use my keys for the auth
process.</p>
<h2 id="option-2">Option 2</h2>
<p>In this option I assume that we have two ssh keys created and ready to use. If
not, follow this step-by-step guide at 
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/">help.github.com</a></p>
<p>Back to the topic. I can make ssh config to handle it for me. First of all
I need to create or edit ~/.ssh/config and configure two or more hosts in there.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"># Personal Github</span>
Host github-cringedcoder
HostName github.com
<span class="hljs-keyword">User</span> <span class="hljs-title">cringedcoder</span>
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cringedcoder

<span class="hljs-comment"># Work</span>
Host github.com
HostName github.com
<span class="hljs-keyword">User</span> <span class="hljs-title">git</span>
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code></pre>
Later if I want to write code as cringedcoder I have to provide address with
changed hostname.

<pre><code class="hljs bash">git <span class="hljs-built_in">clone</span> git@github-cringedcoder:cringedcoder/cringedcoder.github.io.git</code></pre>
Also if I already have cloned repo and I want to change account without cloning
it again, I change url in [remote "origin"] section in .git/config file of the
repo, or simply 
<pre><code class="hljs bash">git remote <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>-url origin git@github-cringedcoder:cringedcoder/cringedcoder.github.io.git</code></pre>
And then I have to change user for this specific repo in case of commit user
mismatch.
<pre><code class="hljs bash">git config user.name <span class="hljs-string">"Cringed Coder"</span>
git config user.email <span class="hljs-string">"[ommited]"</span></code></pre>

            <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
